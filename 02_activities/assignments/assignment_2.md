# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Good visualization:  https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/pradeepkumar.g/viz/FoodieFindsinBengaluru/Home

      - Aesthetically pleasing
      - simple bold colours 
      - Readable texts
      - Eye-catching images used - without reading any information, we know that the visualization is food-releated.
      - Data hierachy:  KPIs are obvious and detail data points
      - Visualization Hierachy:  Author starts with focus on a single map visuaziation, ability to drill down
      - Visualization sepearation:  Report is divided into 3 sections for readibility data exploration by users.



      Bad :  https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ann.jackson/viz/SuperBowl2018LIIBigGameBattle/BIGGAMEBATTLE

      - The visualization is not easily readable.
      - No clear text hierachy.
      - Not enough information for the average reader, more context needed.
      - the visualization are too "busy".
      - Lack of legend/information 






      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Good visualization:  Perhaps use another image other than a pizza for Food Type becuase users may assume the visulization is about Italian food only.  


Bad:  Everything :  e.g. Define a clear purpose/topic of the visualization, use a different type of visualization and texts. 
      
      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
